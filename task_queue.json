Add integration tests: recording + search, plugin lifecycle, session recovery. Document architecture and plugin API in ARCHITECTURE.md and PLUGINS.md. If you want, I can convert these into a ready-to-run task queue JSON so Claude Code can pick them up directly in your autonomous development loop. Do you want me to do that next?",
